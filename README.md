ROOT macros to draw some Feyman diagrams

1. **photonFusionLeptons.c** macro to prduce the diagram of photon-photn fusion into two leptons at tree level. Landscape orientation. It has an option to draw the lepton with an arrow (default) or with a line, for the second execute the script using passing *false* as parameter.

2. **photonFusionX.c** macro to produce a diagram of photon-photon fusion into a generic state x. Interaction representat as a blob. Portrait orientation. It has an option to draw the final state with an arrow (default) or with a line, for the second execute the script using passing *false* as parameter.
